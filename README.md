# Davide Bruner's Portfolio

_View my website [here](https://davidebruner.github.io/)._

The project has been bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) and nothing more.

## âœ¨ Technology

1.  **Next.js**

    [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)  is a site generator for React that specializes in fast, static sites, so it's a perfect starting point for a React site hosted on GitHub Pages. 


2.  **React.js**

    [React](https://reactjs.org/) is a flexible, non-opinionated JavaScript library for front-end development.


3.  **GitHub Pages**

    GitHub offers free hosting for static sites via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

## ðŸš€ Deploy

The static generated site is deployed on Github Pages using the [`peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3`](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/github-pages-action) github action. (the `next export` command generates the build into the `./out` directory by default)

Check `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` for more details.
