This is my personal web page built in [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) 

The project has been bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) and nothing more.
It's hosted on Github Pages.

## Installation

Just run `npm i` or `yarn`.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Deploy

The static generated site is deployed on Github Pages using the `peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3` github action. (the `next export` command generates the build into the `./out` directory by default)

Check `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` for more details.
