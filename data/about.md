<p>Hi there, my name is Davide Bruner and I'm a fullstack developer and frontend &amp; designer enthusiast currently living in 🇪🇸 Malaga, Spain.</p>
<p>
  Right now I’m working as Freelancer Consultant for 
  <a href='https://bitrefill.com/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'> The European Commision</a>, <a href='https://kelyon.com/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Kelyon</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Before that I worked at <a href='https://www.tracklib.com/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Momentive.ai (formerly SurveyMonkey)</a>
</p>
<p>
  I grew up in Naples just and come from a background of studying Photography. I love working in the realm between design and code. Some stuff that makes me excited
  are CSS, React, Design Systems, Component Kits, UI Animation and delightful interfaces ✨.
</p>
<p>
  In my spare time I love being outdoors, training and travelling with my family </br>(check out <a href='https://www.instagram.com/DavideBru/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'> @DavideBru </a> ✈️).
